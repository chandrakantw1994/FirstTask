<h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
<h3>Let me just brief you about the project structure</h3>
<p><b><i>Language used:</i></b> I have used <b>JAVA</b> Language in this Project</p>

<p><b><i>Framework Used:</i></b> I have used TestNG testing Framework using Page Object Model Design Pattern</p>

<p><b><i>Packages:</i></b> I have created seperated packages for Base class, Pages classes and Test class. All the web page related classes come under 
the Pages package and all the tests related classes come under Tests package</p>

<p><b><i>Extent Reports: </i></b> For the reporting purpose, I have used Extent Reports. It generates beautiful HTML reports, such as index.html and emailable-report.html</p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>I have used Maven as Project Management tool while creating this Poject so that I can add various dependencies and also integrated testNG dependency in pom.xml so that I can run this pom.xml file using Jenkins or command prompt, for continuos testing on a daily basis and also for nightly execution.  </li>
</ul>
